inductive learning used for machine learning
inductive takes in data to extrapalate and make predictions
doesn't predict with abs certainy however
data->model->prediction (not sound reasoning)
algorithimic

abductive reasoning:
involves guesswork
draws on partial info/data, usually pick most obvious sol

deductive reasoning:
sound form of reasoning
application of algorithimic process to set of assumptions
ex: assume x=1, deduce x+1=?
by correctly applying rules of addition x+1 can be guranteed to =2
ex: assume x=1, y=2 then x=1 & y=2 is true also x=1 OR y=10 is true
& operator is communatitive (A&B = B&A)

with mathematical reasoning start with set of basic assumptions that are assumed to be true-> axioms
inference rules-combine axioms
theorem: propositions shown to be true we can apply to dedeuctively derive more conclusions (kinda like axiom)


natural numbers: set of counting numbers (0,1,2,3,..) N
integers: set of positive and negative counting numbers (-1,0,1,..) Z
rational numbers: set of numbers expressed as fractions Q
real numbers: set of all non-imaginary numbers R
complex numbers: set of numbers with real and imaginary partial

intuitively we want to say every object is = to itself
type theory: for every type, T, if I have object of that kind, t, then t=T
1=1 is true by applying axiom of equality with type Real number
