-introduction rule- rule that creates proof, returns proof
elimination rule-creates a proof of equality (0=0), takes in proof as arg
conjecture-proposition you beleive is true but don't yet have prooved

to prove forall conjecture, pick arbirtrary object to work with in proof
THE intro rule for eq: ref of eq, 
elimination rule for eq-sub of eq
can go in reverse order: from proof goal to inputs to axioms etc (base level is axioms)
 for all intro rule: assume given arbitrary object and work with that object
